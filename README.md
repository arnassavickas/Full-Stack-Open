# Full Stack Open Submissions

**Hey, I'm Arnas.**

I am learning to code on my free time. After finishing CS50 and a few parts of FreeCodeCamp, I have decided to start University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course after reading some nice reviews on Reddit. I this repository I will be submitting this course's exercises.

## Folders

Each folder is dedicated for each course's part, thus named part 0, part 1 etc.
