# Full Stack Open Submissions

**About Full Stack Open 2020 course**

This course was my third step in my path of learning to code. After finishing CS50 and a few parts of FreeCodeCamp, I have decided to start University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course after reading some nice reviews on Reddit. This repository was used for submitting exercises for each part of the couse.

## Impressions

I was left really satisfied with this well-made introductory course to web-development. In the span of around 110 hours, I have finished 10/12 parts and decided to move on to doing my personal projects.
A short review about each part:

 - Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps:  learnt about HTTP protocol, DOM, how to read request and response headers.
 - Part 1 - Introduction to React: went straight to learning all of the modern **React** practices with **hooks**, but also familiarized with classes.
 - Part 2 - Communicating with server: learnt about Promises, started to use axios to make calls to the server.
 - Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express: probably the toughest part, where I started to use a lot of new technologies: writing **REST API** on **NodeJS** with **Express**, **MongoDB** as a database with **Mongoose**, deploying the app to **Heroku** and **ESlint**.
 For easier deployment, part 3 is in [another repository](https://github.com/arnassavickas/Full-Stack-Open-part3).
 - Part 4 - Testing Express servers, user administration: learnt to authenticate the user and how to write unit tests with **jest**.
 - Part 5 - Testing React apps: wrote _End to End_ (E2E) tests using **Cypress**.
 - Part 6 - State management with Redux: introduced to state management library **Redux**, learnt how to integrate it with React.
 - Part 7 - React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack: a lot of new information about ways to use React. Learnt how to configure webpack, how to React using **Material UI**.
 - Part 8 - GraphQL: introduced **GraphQL** into the project as an alternative to REST.
 - Part 9 - Typescript: learnt about the joy of using **Typescript**.

## Folders

Each folder is dedicated for each course's part, thus named part 0, part 1 etc.
